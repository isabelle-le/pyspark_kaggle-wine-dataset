# Approach
I am using 4 ML classification algorithm in my projects :Naive Bayes, LSVM, Decision tree and Random forest

# How to run
I proposed two way to run and test it yourself

1st way: required tools: python 3, pyspark, jupyter notebook

2nd way: use databricks
Open your free community account >> create a cluster >>attach this notebook to try it yourself
